# Deprecated

`rhasspy-satellite` has been deprecated in favor of a [custom virtual environment install]https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/#customizing-installation). Using `./configure` variables like `RHASSPY_SPEECH_SYSTEM` and `RHASSPY_WAKE_SYSTEM` or options like `--disable-speech-to-text` and `--disable-training`, you can configure a satellite to have exactly what you need.
